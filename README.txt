This was forked a _long_ time ago from http://fte.sf.net/ ... 

The original README is below, but this fork diverged from the
original decades ago. Don't send Marko bug reports for this fork.

I have fixed a few things, updated it for modern compilers,
changed a few things to my liking, and added SDL and OpenGL
builds, which will work on most things without having to write
_more_ platform-specific code. In modern times, I use the SDL
build exclusively.

People often ask me why I use this as my primary development
tool, and it's because I found FTE at a time in my life when
I was hopping between MS-DOS, OS/2 and Linux, and my primary
development tool was DOS EDIT, and QuickBASIC's text editor.

FTE offered more power than that--undo, syntax highlighting,
etc--but with roughly the same keybindings as DOS EDIT and
ports to all the platforms I was using, so I switched.

Now I have so much muscle memory for it, I just love using
it, warts and limitations and all. Being a million years
old, it's resource usage is wildly low.

There are better, more powerful, and also-portable tools, so
I don't recommend FTE to newcomers, but since I use it, I
maintain a fork because no one else will, and it's good to
own your tools.
